# Election Prediction in Turkey

This project aims to predict the results of the next election in Turkey using data from web surveys and linear regression. The project uses Python and various data science libraries to collect, preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data, and then train and evaluate a linear regression model to make predictions based on the data.

## Data Collection

The project uses web scraping techniques to collect data from various web surveys related to the election in Turkey. The surveys may include questions about political preferences, demographic information, and other relevant factors that may affect the election outcome. The data is collected using Python and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the web pages and extract the relevant information.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data is then preprocessed to clean, transform, and aggregate the data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. This may include removing missing or invalid data, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, and merging data from different sources. The preprocessing is done using Python and the pandas library, which provides powerful tools for data manipulation.

## Data Analysis

The preprocessed data is then analyzed using various statistical and visualization techniques to explore the relationships between the variables and identify potential predictors of the election outcome. This may include calculating descriptive statistics, visualizing the distributions and correlations of the variables, and conducting hypothesis tests to assess the significance of the relationships. The analysis is done using Python and libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scipy and statsmodels for statistical analysis.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Based on the analysis results, a linear regression model is trained to predict the election outcome based on the available predictors. The model is trained using Python and the scikit-learn library, which provides a convenient and flexible interface for machine learning tasks. The model is then evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and cross-validation, to assess its performance and generalization ability. The evaluation results are used to fine-tune the model parameters and improve its accuracy.

## Results and Conclusion

Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on new data, and the results are presented in a report or dashboard format, along with the key insights and limitations of the model. The report may also include recommendations for future data collection and analysis to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict the election outcome in Turkey based on web survey data. While the results are subject to various uncertainties and biases, the project provides a useful framework for exploring and modeling complex phenomena using data-driven approaches.
